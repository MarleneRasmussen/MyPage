  <h2>Our Journey from Hobby to Business</h2>
  <p class="p-dark">
    We began our journey with ceramics as a simple hobby—a passion for shaping clay and creating something unique with our hands. It was a therapeutic process where we found joy in experimenting with different techniques and designs. Every time we worked with the clay, we felt a connection to its history and the traditions that stretch back thousands of years.
  </p>
  <p class="p-dark">
    As our skills grew, it became clear that we wanted more than just to make bowls and pots. We wanted to create something of high quality, which is why we chose to work with the finest clay types, such as porcelain and stoneware. These materials allow us to craft strong and durable products that are also aesthetically pleasing. We invest time in understanding the various qualities and properties of clay so that we can maximize the potential of each piece.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our passion for ceramics transformed from a hobby into a lifestyle, and it took courage to take the next step and start our own business. In the beginning, we sold our works at local markets, where we received direct feedback from customers. It was here that we realized how much we loved sharing our craft with others. Each creation tells a story and carries our heart and dedication.
  </p>
  <p class="p-dark">
    We put a great deal of our heart and soul into every piece of pottery we make. It’s not just about creating functional items; it’s also about bringing beauty and personality into everyday life. Our customers deserve the best, and we always strive to deliver products that are not only unique but also sustainable.
  </p>
  <p class="p-dark">
    Today, we are proud to have transformed our hobby into a business that connects tradition with innovation. Our collections span various design categories that we hope you will explore. From <strong>Black and White</strong> to <strong>Colorful</strong>, <strong>Modern</strong>, and <strong>Nature</strong>—each category has its own character and inspiration. You can find our work in the gallery <a href="gallery.html">here</a>, where you can see the different pieces we have created.
  </p>
  <p class="p-dark">
    We aim to cater to everyone’s styles and preferences, which is why we also offer the opportunity to design your own piece of pottery. This interactive process allows you to create something that truly reflects your personality and style. Whether you have a specific idea in mind or simply want to explore your creative abilities, we are here to help. Learn more about how you can design your own pottery <a href="design.html">here</a>.
